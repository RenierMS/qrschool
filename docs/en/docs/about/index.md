## PROBLEM STATEMENT

The educational institution Colegio Ramon B. Jimeno E.A.A.B, is a special
district institution located in the city of Bogotá D.C. in the department of
Cundinamarca. The Board of Directors of the E.A.A.B Company, through Resolution
No. 0031 of December 16, 1971, created the Association and established the
statutes governing its operations. It was assigned the name after the first promoter of a water
company in the city of Bogotá: Ramón B. Jimeno. It was established as a mixed
secondary school for the children of the employees and pensioners of the public
company, with its management and operation entrusted to the 
Bogota Water and Sewerage Company.
The Ramon B Jimeno educational institution has a platform that allows them to manage the information of their students.
The system includes several functionalities, among which are management of each student's grades, their average in each subject, and theiir general academic data. It also includes an alert system for tracking absences and a portal for
scheduling nursing appointments. The current system is efficient, but its functionalities are relatively, basic, focusing on managing 
student information, appointment scheduling, and traking score in each subject.

Therefore, the institution requires a technological improvement to enable the 
automation and centralization of academic management, with the aim of enhancing 
efficiency and effectiveness in managing academic information. It is
essential to implement academic management software that allows the integration of
various existing systems and applications provided by the Ministry of
Education, as well as the automation of institutional processes. This software should offer user
management capabilities, report generation, visualization of
statistics, among other relevant features.

The improvement, design, and implementation of this academic management software, including access modules and student attendance control, requiere a thorough planning
process and effective project management. This process should involve all stakeholders with in the
educational community and incluide mechanisms for monitoring and evaluating the software modifications to ensure its long-term sustainability.

Among the various software improvements for the educational institution, our primary focus will be on maintaining a comprehensive record of enrolled students, including their personal information and attendance data. Additionally, we will implement a system for real-time notification of
absence to parents.

## JUSTIFICATION

- Register student absenteeism to subsequently analyze and aggregate the      results on a dashboard that can be accessed daily by teachers,             administrators and guardians.
- Reduce the time required to register student attendance at the              institution's entrance and in each class by implementing QR codes and
  smartphones, which will also send alerts to software administrators.

## SCOPE

Teachers, students and staff of the Ramon B. Jimeno E.A.A.B School have acces to the attendance record module.

## GOALS

### GENERAL OBJECTIVE

Create software to record the attendance control of students at the Ramon B.
Jimeno E.A.A.B School that presents the information in a configurable dashboard. The software should also grant reading and modification permissions based on the roles of the people in the educational institution.

### SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES

- Facilitate access to academic information for guardians and guardians.
- Reduce the risk of errors and omissions in academic management.
- Ensure that confidential information of students and teachers is adequately
  protected and that data is accessible only to authorized persons depending on
  the ROLE.
- Activate or deactivate specific students and roles.
- Manage attendance: teachers will be able to record student attendance in
  class.
- Collect data: the software will record the time, the student's code and     the
  code of the person who made the record; Through a dashboard, the            information
  can be analyzed or the API can be connected with Microsoft Power BI or
  Tableau.
- Offer real-time information: The software will provide real-time            information
  about the attendance record and grades.

## RISKS

## LIMITATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS

The project has the following limitations and restrictions:

- Budget constraints: The project must be executed with a limited budget,     utilizing the technological and human resources available with in the G3    study group of file 2675809 of the SENA virtual training process –          Software Analysis and Development.
- Limited technological and human resources: To minimize expenses related     to licensing, the project will rely on technological tools and free
  software development methodologies.
