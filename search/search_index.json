Jimeno E.A.A.B, is a special District institution located in the city of Bogot\u00e1 D.C. in the department of Cundinamarca, The Board of Directors of the E.A.A.B Company through Resolution No. 0031 of December 16, 1971 created the Association and established the statutes of its order. It was assigned the name of the first promoter of a water company in the city of Bogot\u00e1: Ram\u00f3n B. Jimeno. It was established as a mixed secondary school for the children of the employees and pensioners of the public company, whose management and operation was left under the responsibility of the Bogota Water and Sewerage Company, The Ramon B Jimeno educational institution has a platform which allows them to manage the information of their students, the system includes several functionalities, among which are; management of the grades of each student and her average in each subject and general average of her academic data, it also has an alert system to absences and a portal for scheduling nursing appointments. The current system is efficient but as we can see its functionalities are simple in the sense that it only manages basic student information, appointment scheduling, and their score in each subject.</p> <p>Therefore, the institution requires a technological improvement that allows the automation and centralization of academic management, in order to improve efficiency and effectiveness. in academic information management. It is necessary to have academic management software that allows the integration of different existing systems and applications provided by the Ministry of Education and the automation of the processes of the institution that has user management and permits, the creation of reports, the visualization of statistics, among other relevant features.</p> <p>The improvement, design and implementation of this academic management software (access modules, student attendance control) specifically; involves a planning process and proper project management, involving all stakeholders in the educational community, and a process for monitoring and evaluating the modification to the software implemented to ensure its long-term sustainability.</p> <p>Of all the improvements to the software of the educational institution, we will focus on keeping a record of the students enrolled in the institution, including information such as their personal data and assistance; also the live report of absence to parents.</p>"},{"location":"about/about/#justification","title":"JUSTIFICATION","text":"<ul> <li>Register student absenteeism, to later analyze and group the results in a   dashboard that can be consulted daily by teachers, administrators and   guardians.</li> <li>Reduce the attendance registration time of students at the entrance of the   institution and each of the classes through the use of QR code and   smartphones, sending alerts to software administrators.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"about/about/#scope","title":"SCOPE","text":"<p>Teachers, students and staff of the Ramon B.
